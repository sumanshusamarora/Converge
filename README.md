# Converge
Converge is an open-source framework for coordinated, multi-repository software development using AI agents. It enables agents working across independent codebases to collaborate, agree, and ship changes through bounded negotiation, shared evidence, and human-in-the-loop governance without endless loops or unsafe automation.
